# Weather Forecasting Project
==========================

### Introduction
---------------

This repository houses a Kedro-based data science pipeline aimed at developing a robust weather forecasting application.

### Background
-------------

Weather forecasting plays a significant role in various fields such as agriculture, transportation, and emergency management. This project seeks to leverage machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to predict future weather conditions based on historical climate data.

### Project Overview
----------------

The project utilizes the following data sources:

*   [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) historical weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
*   National Weather Service precipitation dataset
*   Other relevant meteorological datasets (if available)

Machine learning algorithms employed in this project include:

*   Linear Regression and decision tree-based models
*   Random Forest ensemble techniques for improved accuracy

### Project Goals
-----------------

The main goals of this project are to:

1.  Develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict future weather conditions.
2.  Enhance the forecasting capabilities using transfer learning techniques (if necessary).
3.  Utilize real-time data integration and API calls from OpenWeatherMap for optimal results.

### Technologies Used
---------------------

*   **Kedro**: A Python library used for building, maintaining, and scaling complex data science pipelines.
*   **Python**: Primary programming language for the project.
*   **NumPy**, **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis libraries in Python.
*   **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library featuring various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, etc.
